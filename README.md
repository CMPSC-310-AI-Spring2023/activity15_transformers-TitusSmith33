# CMPSC 310 Activity 15

## Deadline: April 12 by 9:50am

## Assignment

 For this activity follow [Neural machine translation with a Transformer and Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/transformer).

## Submission

Submit completed Colab notebook showing generated output.

## Data

The data found in this tutorial is a data set from Tensor Flow of a data set full of Portuguese-English translations. This dataset has about 52,000 training sets, 1,200 validation sets, and 1,800 test cases. The program then breaks down all the words and gives them numerical value and tries to rebuild it back up to human readable text, a process called tokenizing. Lastly, it tests the data set to ensure that the data has been processed correctly.

## Transformer Components

Explain the trainsformer model and add subsectios that explains what is part of the transformer does.
